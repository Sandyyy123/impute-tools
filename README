This is the source code repository of the Julian Knight group.
It is meant to host the code base for all software tools developed
in the group. Different tools should use different branches of the 
repository.

To clone only the branch for a specific tool:
git clone --single-branch --branch <branch name> ssh://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk/data/backup/git/jknight.git <branch name>

To create a branch for a new tool:
## first clone the master branch to get a clean copy
git clone ssh://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk/data/backup/git/jknight.git

## then add the branch
git branch <branch name>
git push origin <branch name>
git checkout <branch name>
git branch --set-upstream <branch name> origin/<branch name>
git pull

Now add the initial version of the sources and push them to the
central repository.

The repository is connected to a Trac wiki and issue tracker at
http://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk:8000
